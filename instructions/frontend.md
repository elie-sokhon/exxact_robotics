# Exxact Robotics - Frontend Developer Test üõ†

## The Web Application

We would like you to develop a simple web application. For the frontend, feel free to use your preferred technology to showcase your skills.

Through your app, we would like you to:

 - Display the installations on a map.
 - Display the installations in a table.
 - Create a card to display information about one installation when selected.
 - Create a form to filter installations by `codepostal`, `statutseveso`, or `etatactivite`.
 - Create a form to modify the information of an installation (since no backend is implemented, mock the API call).

### Bonus Steps

The following are not mandatory but would be great to see:

 - Add graphs.
 - Deploy your application to a cloud platform of your choice.
 - Have some cool ideas? Go for it! üëç
