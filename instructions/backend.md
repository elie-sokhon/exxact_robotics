# Exxact Robotics - Backend Developer Test üõ†

## Step 1: Data Integration

We would like you to integrate the data into a database. Feel free to use the technology that seems most appropriate.

## Step 2: REST API

For the backend, we would like you to write REST APIs to retrieve the installations:

 - List all the installations.
 - Return lists filtered by `codepostal`, `statutseveso`, or `etatactivite`.
 - Get a single installation.
 - Modify an installation.
 - Delete an installation.

Pay attention to the HTTP methods and status codes you use!

### Bonus Steps

The following are not mandatory but would be excellent to see:

 - Deploy your application to a cloud platform of your choice.
 - Have some cool ideas? Go for it! üëç
