# Exxact Robotics - Fullstack Developer Test üõ†

## Step 1: REST API

For the backend, we would like you to write REST APIs to retrieve the installations:

 - List all the installations.
 - Return lists filtered by `codepostal`, `statutseveso`, or `etatactivite`.
 - Get a single installation.

Pay attention to the HTTP methods and status codes you use!

For this test, there is no need to use a database.

## Stage 2: The Web Application

In this case, we would like you to develop a simple web application. For the frontend, we would love to see what you can do, so feel free to use your preferred technology.

Via your app, we would like you to:

 - Display the installations on a map using the API created in the backend.
 - Choose a commune and display only the related installations.
 - Display the information of a specific installation.
 - Apply the different filters (created in the previous step).

### Bonus Steps

The following are not mandatory but would be excellent to see:

 - Display the installations in a table on the frontend.
 - Add graphs on the frontend.
 - Deploy your application to a cloud platform of your choice.
 - Have some cool ideas? Go for it! üëç
