# Exxact Robotics - Developer Test ðŸ› 

Hi! We're glad you want to join Exxact Robotics! We've designed this test so that you can show us how you think about a problem and how you implement its solution. We'll discuss it during our next meeting.

## Project

The Pays de la Loire Region wants to have a web application to observe their installations classified for environmental protection. They provided you with the [dataset.geojson file](./data/etablissements_icpe_pays_loire.geojson) containing these installations.

Here is the information that is most relevant for the user:
 - "raisonsociale"
 - "adresse1"
 - "codepostal"
 - "commune"
 - "statutseveso"
 - "etatactivite"
 - "prioritenationale"

## Instructions

Follow only one of these instructions regarding the position you are applying for

- [Fullstack test instructions](./instructions/fullstack.md)
- [Frontend test instructions](./instructions/frontend.md)
- [Backend test instructions](./instructions/backend.md)

## Modalities

Don't pass more than 4 hours on this test. Do as much as possible within the given time. If you are unable to finish, specify what blocked you and what remains to be done.

Create a private repository on GitHub to store your source code, invite HugoB-EXR and StuartEXR as collaborators, and send us the link by email once you've finished.  
Please provide a README with instructions to run your project.

Once we've had a good look at your web app, we will get together and discuss the results.
